## Hi there üëã

# Hi, I'm Damian üëã

Hi, I'm Damian, a third-year IT student at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. I'm passionate about web development, software engineering, and networking, with a particular interest in data transmission and how information flows across networks. Always eager to learn new technologies, I focus on building strong foundations in web technologies, problem-solving, and application design.

I enjoy exploring different aspects of software development, from front-end to back-end, and am excited to dive deeper into full-stack development. Additionally, I am fascinated by the complexities of data transfer, networking protocols, and how systems communicate over the internet.

Through my studies and personal projects, I aim to build practical, user-friendly applications and contribute to the tech community.

Feel free to explore my projects to see how I'm applying my knowledge and passion for technology in real-world scenarios.
